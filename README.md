### Hi there 👋

🔭 At Work I’m currently working on a C++/Qt crypto application for sharing files safely using symmetrical or asymmetrical keys used by the swedish government and many more.  
🌱 On my spare time I’m currently learning more about React, NextJs, MongoDB, GraphQL and GraphQL among other techniques to evolve my frontend skillset.  
🐱‍🏍 I will hopefully focus more on games in the upcoming year
